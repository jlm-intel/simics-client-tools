# This script searches for *.log in the specified target directory (or . if no dir specified) and extracts any
# case-insensitive instance of "error", "fail", "exception", or "TraceBack" into separate TXT files.
# It also combines those results into a single "combined.txt" file, with a separate version with all known
# timestamp formats removed ("nostamps-combined.txt"). You can use these to quickly find all possible errors
# in a set of test log files.
#
# You can use comparefiles.py to compare the resulting TXT files between two test results to find differences
# in the errors reported between two test runs. (It can identify unique errors between two tests.)
